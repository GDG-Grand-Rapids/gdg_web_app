Welcome to the fifth consecutive Google I/O Extended in Grand Rapids!

Google I/O is an annual event hosted by Google to highlight the latest in technology and product innovation. This covers topics such as IoT, distributed computing, advancements in mobile technology, and more.

Google live-streams this event and encourages other communities to hold live watch-parties. In Grand Rapids, we take this opportunity to stream the keynote from Google, but also to pull together the West Michigan tech community. This year's Google I/O Extended will be hosted at New Holland Brewing's newest venue, The Knickerbocker.

The conference will be different from I/O's of the past, with a focus on networking, good food, and an atmosphere for learning. This year will not have a large auditorium. Instead it will feature a distributed configuration with many TVs to watch Google provided content, and smaller, intimate presentations (fireside chats) throughout the two day event.

We are selling general admission tickets on a per day basis. In order to attend, you _must_ buy a ticket(s) on Eventbrite: https://io18extended.eventbrite.com.
